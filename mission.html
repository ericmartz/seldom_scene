				If you&#39;re like me, your iTunes music library keeps growing.  More and more songs added all the time- my bloated library now totals in the thousands- and as that song library grows, it becomes more and more difficult to stay in touch with them all, to keep hearing them all in rotation. Eventually, it becomes impossible. The more songs you add to your library, the more some have to fall away from your listening experience.<br>
				The same principle holds true in the theatre. Each year there are new plays- and each new season of plays increases the total number of plays which have been produced over time. And no matter how great some of those plays might be, there&#39;s no way we can keep reviving them all, since new works take the time and space which the old works previously occupied. But this is a good thing. An art form that isn&#39;t constantly infused with new inspiration and ideas is a dead form. New work is the life&#39;s blood of art. And so, because of those limitations of time and space, the life span of a play- any play- should be expected to be as brief as a mayfly;  it&#39;s here and then it&#39;s gone, making way for yet newer works. Seldom Scene Theatre, therefore, celebrates rather than mourns the necessary passing of the old and the making way for the new. Seldom Scene Theatre produces new theatre with the understanding that it will in fact be seldom seen- the brief life it gives to each production may very well be the only life that new work will ever receive, and therefore, that life must be as glorious as possible, exemplifying first-rate production values, exciting acting, solid literary content, and the most pleasing of audience experiences (which means decent red wine at the concession stand. Finally!)

 				Art for art&#39;s sake- this is why Seldom Scene Theatre exists. No political or social agenda, no ax to grind, no &quot;reason to be&quot; other than to put new, previously unproduced original plays on their feet.  And by &quot;new,&quot; we mean truly new- no adaptations or reworkings of stories which have already been told. As for style, Seldom Scene Theatre leans away from the &quot;realistic&quot; and instead embraces the surreal and the absurd, the abstract and the symbolic, the mysterious and the magical.   Seldom Scene Theatre believes that art which is most exciting is born from the Impression, from impulse spawned by instinct, and to that instinctual Impression, Craft and Intellect are then applied. Impulse followed by intellect, not the other way around- a distinction which is more than mere philosophical nitpicking but the functional formula to create the kind of theatrical art which is both vital and volatile.
