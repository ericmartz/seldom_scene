			<h1>The Reason for Seldom Scene Theatre</h1> 
			<hr>
 			<p>
 				Art for art&#39;s sake- this is why Seldom Scene Theatre exists. No political or social agenda, no ax to grind, no reason to be other than to put new, previously unproduced original plays on their feet.  And by &quot;new,&quot; we mean truly new- no adaptations or reworkings of stories which have already been told. As far as style, Seldom Scene Theatre leans away from the &quot;realistic&quot; and instead embraces the surreal and the absurd, the abstract and the symbolic, the mysterious and the magical.   Seldom Scene Theatre believes that art which is most exciting is born from the Impression, from impulse spawned by instinct, and to that instinctual Impression, Craft and Intellect are then applied. Impulse followed by intellect, not the other way around- a distinction which is more than mere philosophical nitpicking but the functional formula to create the kind of theatrical art which is both vital and volatile. Oh, and good booze too. Booze helps.
