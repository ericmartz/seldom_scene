Below are some sentences in synopsis form about the play...

				Hunkered down somewhere amidst the cattle ranches, grain silos and soybean fields of the Nebraska badlands sits the High Plains prairie homestead of the Peterson clan. But if you&#39;re thinking Little House On The Prairie, think again. Defending life, liberty and property against cyclones, hailstones, blizzards and badger infestation are Big Mama and her mama, The Titless Wonder (a nickname earned from her battle with breast cancer, a nickname she wears with pride). These are no-bullshit broads, and always ready to prove it. Big Mama, in her latest attempt at achieving sobriety, has left the temptations of the big city and returned to her childhood home with her brood of young &#39;uns in tow, a move which has brought the town&#39;s nosy neighbors out onto their manicured lawns with their binoculars for a look at the goings-on. Titless Wonder&#39;s eldest son Dan, the well-meaning but ineffectual Sheriff of the little town, checks in on his mother and sister like the dutiful son/brother he is, but it&#39;s not as if the wimmen folk need his help for anything. They&#39;ve got it covered, thanks, this life they&#39;re scratching out against the elements, until a living ghost from the past appears- Titless Wonder&#39;s youngest son Stevie, who&#39;s created for himself a new persona called Reno Nevada, and has returned for... well, that&#39;s the question. For what? The chip on his shoulder is boulder-sized, and he&#39;s clearly scheming to get what&#39;s his- whatever that is- and by any means necessary. Meanwhile, as Big Mama battles 24/7 to keep her addictive habits from killing her (and her kids from killing each other), the Titless Wonder finds herself embroiled in a battle of her own, against the insidious double-edged sword of dementia and brain cancer. And as the judgemental little town of moralistic, hyper-religious busy-bodies takes increasing exception to Big Mama&#39;s very right to exist, Reno undergoes yet another personality transformation, this time settling upon the cryptic identity which he hopes will bring him the power and adoration he so desperately longs for, one which threatens to rob Big Mama and the Titless Wonder of everything they hold dear. Ultimately, our prairie heroines&#39; united struggle becomes not so much a battle against the ravages of disease, addiction, old age and prairie hardship, but against womankind&#39;s most unrelenting and merciless enemy of all- the male of the species. But don&#39;t imagine for a moment that the life-and-death stakes of such big-time troubles leave no opportunity for humor. What with badger wrasslin, livestock romance, rhinestone cowboys, topless lawn mowing and geriatric gunplay, The Legend of Big Mama and The Titless Wonder presents tragedy in all its comic glory, an &quot;unfit for the entire family&quot; testament to the indomitable spirit of two women in particular and the enduring strength of womankind.
