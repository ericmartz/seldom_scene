			<h1>Seldom Scene Theatre's opening offering- Dave Lauby's &quot;Lewis & Clark and the Death Metal Motorcycle Tribe,&quot; February 2016!</h1>
			<p>
				Seldom Scene Theatre will kick off its operations with the premier production of Dave Lauby's new play &quot;Lewis & Clark and the Death Metal Motorcycle Tribe,&quot; with February of 2016 as the target production slot. Below are some sentences in synopsis form about the play...

				&quot;Didja hear the one about the two professors who walk into a biker bar?&quot;

				What sounds like the first line of a joke is actually the premise of Dave Lauby&#39;s new play, &quot;Lewis & Clark and the Death Metal Motorcycle Tribe.&#39;  Joe Burk (a historian) and his wife Adrienne (an anthropologist) are in rural Tennessee doing research for Joe&#39;s upcoming book about the death of his hero Meriwether Lewis, of Lewis & Clark fame.  Their Saturday night wanderings bring them to Smith T.&#39;s, an out-of-the-way, hard-core biker bar, and despite Joe&#39;s three-piece suit and Adrienne&#39;s Fendi handbag, they settle in for a drink among the leather jackets.  What begins as an innocent nightcap develops into an encounter of historic proportions, literally and figuratively, as the academic and conservative sensibilities of the Burks clash with the tribal counterculture of the Death Metal Hogs.  What results is an explosive (and often brutally comic) collision of rival worlds, with both the Burks and the Hogs finding their philosophies and values called into question and tested to life-and-death extremes.  It&#39;s Enlightenment versus Ignorance, but which side represents which?  (Due to graphic language and situations, &quot;Lewis/Clark/Death Metal Tribe&quot; is a show for mature audiences only.)
