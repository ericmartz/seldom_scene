X More clouds.
X Background color: Make it lighter for less contrast. (Moved from 75% opaque to 45% opaque)
X Extra space on the Coming Next Tab: "* the "Coming Next" tab- could you put a space between the opening headline and the first sentence (above the line which starts "Seldom Scene Theatre will
  kick off its operations..."
X Logo larger (Made the logo 20% bigger, 10% didn't provide hardly ny contrast)
X Style the headings so they look like headings
X Looking for a better font
- Style the content background so it is not just a block of translucent background
- Script the contact form so it works
X Maybe style the homepage so the announcement is larger
X Style the menu (in progress)
