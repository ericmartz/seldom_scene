				Dave Lauby is a playwright, actor, teacher and director with nearly 40 years of experience in the professional theatre. The summer of 2013 saw the world premier of his comedy &quot;The Great McAnigan&quot;, produced by Atlanta&#39;s The Collective Project (in association with ByrdBrane Productions), a production which garnered rave reviews and two Suzi Award nominations. In June of 2014 his comedy &quot;Trash Day&quot; received its world premier at Atlanta&#39;s Out Of Box Theatre, a production which earned the 2014 Metro Atlanta Theatre (MAT) Award for Best Original Work. In the autumn of 2015 Dave&#39;s newest play, &quot;The Legend Of Big Mama And The Titless Wonder&quot;, will be staged in a metro Atlanta theatre space TBD. Four more Dave Lauby plays- &quot;The Scientific Method&quot;, &quot;Lewis &amp; Clark and the Death Metal Motorcycle Tribe&quot;, &quot;Softies&quot;, and &quot;SingleWide&quot;- await future production, and a fifth, &quot;How To Lose Everything&quot;, is the current work-in-progress.
