			<p>
				Dave Lauby is a playwright, actor, teacher and director with nearly 40 years of experience in the professional theatre. The summer of 2013 saw the world premier of his comedy "The Great McAnigan", produced by Atlanta's The Collective Project (in association with ByrdBrane Productions), a production which garnered rave reviews and two Suzi Award nominations. In June of 2014 his comedy "Trash Day" received its world premier at Atlanta's Out Of Box Theatre, a production which earned the 2014 Metro Atlanta Theatre (MAT) Award for Best Original Work. In the winter of 2016 Dave's dark comedy "Lewis & Clark and the Death Metal Motorcycle Tribe" (the Seldom Scene Theatre's inaugural offering) will be staged in an East Atlanta venue TBD. No fewer than five more Dave Lauby plays- "The Legend of Big Mama and the Titless Wonder", "The Scientific Method", "Softies", "SingleWide" and "How To Lose Everything"- await future production, and a sixth, "David Bowie Before He Died", is the current work-in-progress. Dave, his wife and his two chihuahuas live in Atlanta's East Atlanta Village neighborhood.
